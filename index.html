        <h3>Why I became a web developer</h3>
        <p>Well this is a long story. <br>
          <br>I began my journey with a bachelor degree in cultural science. While I was studying I were fascinated by how to work with communication to gain trust and attention from a choosen target group and that´s why I choose to build (with help from a friend) a website to a choir in Gothenburg. I liked both the programming and communication part so after a short brief in my life I decided to continue my journey towards communication studies. <br>
          <br>While I were studying communication I took every opportunity to build websites (again with help from a friend) and started to learn basic programming at my spare time. I also noticed I were more interested in communication on websites than write strategies. <br>
          <br>So, eventually I tried my luck and applied to <a href="http://yrgo.se/utbildningar/media-och-kommunikation/webbutvecklare/">YRGOs</a> web developer program and I were accepted. It´s been a hard and fun journey. The more I learn, the more I understand that there is so much more to learn. It can be a struggle but it is also fun to actually see my own progress. To look back at a code I wrote months ago and see how to improve it, make it more effective and more readable. <br>
          <br>That is why I continue my journey. To get better, to learn new smarter ways, learn new programming languages and make better and safer websites.
